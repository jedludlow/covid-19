# covid-19
Visualizations of COVID-19 data.

## Getting Started

`conda env create` from the root directory of the repository will
create a conda environment suitable for running the main notebook.

After activating the environment, `jupyter lab` will get the notebook
server up and running. Then browse to the notebook of interest.

## Results

The notebook `utah_covid_plots.ipynb` outputs a file called
`covid_multiple_y_axes.png` which is the most interesting plot. That file
will be committed and versioned over time for those who don't want to run
the notebook.
