Visualizations of COVID-19 data.

## Introduction

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I began
experimenting with visualizations of the various metrics tracking
the progression of the disease in the state of Utah. The source
for the data was the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).
I created almost daily updates of the visualizations for about a year.
In March of 2021, The COVID Tracking Project ceased publishing data updates, and I
elected at that time to cease updating the plots, as well.

## Getting Started

`conda env create` from the root directory of the repository will
create a conda environment suitable for running the main notebook.

After activating the environment, `jupyter lab` will get the notebook
server up and running. Then browse to the notebook of interest.

## Results

The notebook `utah_covid_plots.ipynb` outputs three image files that contain
the most interesting plots. Those image files
were committed and versioned over time for those who don't want to run
the notebook.
